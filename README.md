# Factorial of a Number (C)

This C program calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer.

## Description

The program prompts the user to enter a non-negative integer. It then calculates the factorial of that number and displays the result.  The factorial of a non-negative integer *n*, denoted by *n*!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to *n*.  For example, 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.  By definition, 0! = 1.

## How to Compile and Run

1.  **Save the code:** Save the C code in a file named `factorialofanumber.c` (or any other name with a `.c` extension).

2.  **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt and use a C compiler (like GCC) to compile the code. Navigate to the directory where you saved the file and run the following command:

    ```bash
    gcc factorialofanumber.c -o factorialofanumber
    ```

    This will create an executable file named `factorialofanumber` (or `factorialofanumber.exe` on Windows).

3.  **Run:** Execute the compiled program by running the following command in the terminal:

    ```bash
    ./factorialofanumber  # On Linux/macOS
    factorialofanumber.exe # On Windows
    ```

4.  **Input:** The program will prompt you to enter a non-negative integer. Enter the number and press Enter.

5.  **Output:** The program will display the factorial of the entered number.
